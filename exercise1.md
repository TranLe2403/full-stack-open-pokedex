- lint4j, testNG and jeka are responsible for linting, testing and building Java code respectively. 
- There are some alternatives besides Jenkins and GIthub Actions to set up the CI such as Gitlab CI, Azure Pipelines and Circle CI
- I would setup in a cloud-based environment because, in a medium to big size of team, it would help CI to run consistently without any break from the server and being care of maintaining the running machines. In addition, cloud-based environment are better secured than self-hosting services as it uses Linux-based system which is less vulnerable to virus attacks than traditional computer networks. Another reason for choosing the cloud-based environment setup would be because of the current state of the development process. Since the application is to be released soon, it would take up lots of time if the team were to setup a self-hosted CI running environment. In order to make the final decision on which tools should the team use for the cloud-based CI pipeline and get everything up and running as quickly as possible, it would be crucial to know which of the tools has the best support for Java, which repository platform the team is using, and which tool has a configuration file styling that a team member understands fully about.
